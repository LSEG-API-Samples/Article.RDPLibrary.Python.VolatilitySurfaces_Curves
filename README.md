# Instrument Pricing Analytics - Volatility Surfaces

In one of my <a href="https://developers.refinitiv.com/article/discover-our-refinitiv-data-platform-library-part-2" target="_blank">earlier articles</a> on our new Refinitiv Data Platform Library, I briefly covered our Instrument Pricing Analytics (IPA) data content.

As it was meant to be an overview of the RDP Library, I only covered a fraction of the currently available IPA content. I also only highlighted a subset of the types of output that Samuel Schwam  (Director, Enterprise Pricing Analytics), demoed during the <a href="https://developers.refinitiv.com/pages/london-developer-day-agenda" target="_blank">London Developer Day event</a>. 

In the **Volatility Surfaces.ipynb** Notebook I would like to cover one of these content types - the Volatility Surface offering - in more detail.

The specific Volatility Surfaces and Zero Coupon Curve examples used in the Webinar are provided in the two files:
* Vol Surfaces Webinar.ipynb
* ZC Curves Webinar.ipynb  
Link to On-Demand Recording of the Webinar https://solutions.refinitiv.com/LP=13183

You will need to download the **credentials.ipynb** and **plotting_helper.ipynb** files as well.
      
 
#### Acknowledgements
Although I modified the code for the plots in this article (to improve their look and format), the starting point was Samuel Schwalm's (Director, Enterprise Pricing Analytics) Surfaces and Curves notebook - for which I thank him.
